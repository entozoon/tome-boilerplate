# Tome of the Unknown Boilerplate

[**Demonstration**](https://entozoon.github.io/tome-boilerplate/) of how you might go about using the [Tome of the Unknown](https://entozoon.github.io/tome-of-the-unknown) package.

## Install project

    npm i

## Dev

    npm start

## Compile articles (also happens before start/build)

    npm run compile

## Deploy

    npm run build

Then push as normal - the `/docs` folder is set up as the dist for github pages.
